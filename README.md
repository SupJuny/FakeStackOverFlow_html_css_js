# FakeStackOverFlow_html_css_js

This is fake "Stackoverflow" by using html, css, and basic javascript.

To execute the web page, download all files.

1. Install Python3.
2. Open a terminal (Mac or Linux) or Powershell (Windows).
3. Navigate to the directory that has the files.
e.g.) $ cd </path/to/directory>
4. Run the http module as a script from your terminal.
* If Python version returned above is 3.X.X
* On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server" $ python3 -m http.server
5. By default, this will run the server on localhost’s port 8000.
  You can change the port number if something else is running on 8000 by adding a port number like so: python3 -m http.server 3000.
6. Open a browser (Chrome) and open http://localhost:8000 and you will be able to see the application’s index.html.
